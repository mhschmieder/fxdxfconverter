# FxDxfConverter
JavaXF library for embedding DXF entities

This is a JavaFX based library for integrating pre-parsed DXF entities into GUI contexts such as Scene Graph Groups. To include this code in either FxDxfParser or FxGraphicsToolkit introduces too many additional POM dependencies for only a small fraction of the code in either library, so it has been split off from FxGraphicsToolkit after first merging a tiny amount of code into FxDxfParser.
